        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Historical Context</h2>
        <p>
          The Plantation Labour Act of 1951 regulates the working conditions and provides welfare for workers (mostly the planters) in India. The tea industry in India began in the 19th century during British colonialism, with Robert Bruce discovering the potential of tea as a commercial crop. As the industry grew, migrant laborers, primarily from marginalized castes and communities, were brought in to work in tea plantations, enduring harsh working conditions with little to no compensation, healthcare, or housing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To regulate these challenges, earlier attempts like the Plantation Labour Act of 1863 were made. However, post-independence, the new Indian government passed the Tea Plantation Labour Act in 1951, as part of broader labor welfare reforms. It aimed to provide legal protection to workers in the tea plantation industry.

        <p>
          The Tea Plantation Labour Act is a significant piece of legislation that underscores the Indian governments concern for workers welfare and social justice. While significant progress has been made in improving the conditions of laborers in the tea plantation industry, challenges such as social marginalization, illiteracy, and inequalities persist. The Act attempts to address these issues by setting regulations for the welfare of the workers, but its full implementation remains a work in progress.
